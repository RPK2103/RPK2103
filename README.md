<!-- About me Section  as Backstory -->

# 🎮 Back Story
<p align="justify">
  🧩 From cracking math puzzles as a kid to architecting scalable systems in the world of finance, my tech quest has been powered by endless curiosity, creativity, and evolution.

⚔️ Over the past year, I’ve played the role of Software Engineer 1 (Technology Analyst) at 🏰 J.P. Morgan Chase in the Asset & Wealth Management domain. There, I helped build and maintain real-world financial applications with a modern stack — Spring Boot 🪄, JavaScript ✨, Kubernetes 🧙‍♂️, and R for data-driven models 📊.

🏫 Before that, I earned my B. Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from SRM Institute of Science and Technology. That’s where I truly discovered my passion for problem-solving — from DSA battles ⚔️ to creative front-end illusions with React.js and Angular🎨. Along the way, I developed skills in C, C++, and Python to build a solid engineering foundation.

🧠 As I transition to my next quest, I’m leveling up in the AI/ML skill tree to combine software engineering with intelligent, scalable systems. I’m drawn to roles that involve product ownership, creative problem-solving, and making a significant impact.

✨ Beyond code, I’m a dancing bard 💃, a public builder 📣, a blogger ✍️, and an open-source ally 🤝 — I thrive on creating with purpose and community.

👉 If you’re building something epic in AI, full-stack, or product-tech — or just want to chat about the future of tech over a cup of coffee — let’s join forces! 🚀
